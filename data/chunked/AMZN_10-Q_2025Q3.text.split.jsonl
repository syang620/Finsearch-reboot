Financial Statements", "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"], "text": "(unaudited)\n\nWe have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2025 due to seasonal and other factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our healthcare services and production and distribution of video content. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, viewing patterns of capitalized video content, valuation of derivative instruments, and the determination of when to capitalize certain costs relating to new products or service offerings. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis.\n\nEffective January 1, 2025 we changed our estimate of the useful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years. The shorter useful lives are due to the increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The effect of this change in estimate for Q3 2025, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of June 30, 2025 and those acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2025, was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $392 million and a reduction in net income of $298 million, or $0.03 per basic share and $0.03 per diluted share, which primarily impacted our AWS segment. The effect of this change in estimate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2024 and those acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $889 million and a reduction in net income of $677 million, or $0.06 per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share, which primarily impacted our AWS segment.During Q3 2025, we recorded $2.5 billion of expense related to the settlement of a lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This charge was recorded in “Other operating expense (income), net” and impacted our North America segment.For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recorded approximately $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges increased our payroll and related expenses and were recorded primarily in “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” and impacted all of our segments.\n\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\n\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\n\nOther income (expense), net is as follows (in millions):\n\nThe marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(117) million and $220 million in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(1.8) billion and $470 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025 is primarily from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). The reclassification adjustments for the gains on available-for-sale debt securities of $2.3 billion in Q3 2025 and $5.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily from the portions of our convertible notes investments in Anthropic, PBC (“Anthropic”) that were converted to nonvoting preferred stock during Q3 2025 and the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025.\n\nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, customer receivables, net, were $34.3 billion and $38.0 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $11.6 billion and $12.5 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which include amounts related to non-income taxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to “Technology and infrastructure.”We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025.\n\nIncluded in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are the total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music, which as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025 were $19.6 billion and $21.5 billion. Total video and music expense was $5.0 billion and $5.5 billion in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $14.2 billion and $15.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.\n\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $24.6 billion, of which $15.0 billion was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $6.5 billion and $4.1 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025.Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $200 billion as of September 30, 2025. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:Level 1—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n\nThe following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions):\n\n(1)The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $(145) million and $153 million in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(1.8) billion and $341 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.\n\n(2)We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, standby and trade letters of credit, and licenses of digital media content. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies.”\n\nThe following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of September 30, 2025 (in millions):\n\nActual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions.\n\nFrom Q3 2023 to Q4 2024, we invested $5.3 billion in convertible notes from Anthropic, which are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” and as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approximately $13.8 billion. In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Some of these notes converted to nonvoting preferred stock in Q1 2025. As a result of conversions, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and a gain of approximately $3.3 billion was recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment in nonvoting preferred stock was initially recorded at its estimated fair value at the time of the conversion and will be accounted for as a component of our equity investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity-method, with future adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments representing Level 3 fair value measurements recognized in “Other income", "token_len": 1093, "split_index": 2, "split_count": 11, "parent_chunk_index": 4}

As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, equity investments accounted for under the equity-method of accounting, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, had a carrying value of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion.We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, these warrants had a fair value of $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets. These non-marketable investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.Certain of our investments represent a variable interest in an entity for which we do not consolidate because we are not the primary beneficiary.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\n\nWe have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases for fulfillment network, data center, office, and physical store facilities as well as server and networking equipment, aircraft, and vehicles. Gross assets acquired under finance leases, including those where title transfers at the end of the lease, are recorded in “Property and equipment, net” and were $56.5 billion and $56.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025.

The first of these complaints was Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc., which was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (“W.D. Wash.”). These complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, structural relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Some of the private plaintiff cases include allegations of distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. Some of the cases include allegations that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores, marketplace services, or intermediation services and that we unlawfully engage in anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, selection of the Featured Offers, use of seller data, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. In the U.S., most of Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part, but in each case, at least some of the claims survived. In Canada, class certification was denied in a case before the Federal Court of Canada, finding that plaintiffs had not stated a viable claim, and plaintiffs’ appeal of that ruling is pending. Two Canadian class actions before other courts are pre-certification. In the United Kingdom, two class actions have been certified and a third is pre-certification. In the U.S., one class action has been certified, and three others are pre-certification. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of €1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. In September 2025, the Italian Administrative Tribunal (the “TAR”) affirmed the ICA’s decision but reduced the fine to €752 million. We believe the TAR’s ruling affirming the ICA’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.See also “Note 7 — Income Taxes.”\n\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had $54.3 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”).

The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $50.2 billion and $47.9 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.As of September 30, 2024, we had repaid outstanding borrowings and terminated the secured revolving credit facility with a lender that was secured by certain seller receivables (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility bore interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and had a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion.In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. The Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the entire amount of the Term Loan had been repaid.We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $30.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In April 2025, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $20.0 billion to $30.0 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.We have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025.As of September 30, 2025, we had a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement”). The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. In October 2025, we replaced the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement with a new $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders on substantially the same terms, which matures in October 2026 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders.\n\nWe also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $151 million and $220 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $10.6 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2025.\n\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2025. As of September 30, 2025, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.\n\nEmployees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years. The majority of restricted stock unit awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 as part of the annual compensation review and primarily vest quarterly in the relevant compensation year.\n\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.9 billion and 11.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

Our income tax provision\n\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $14.1 billion, which included $354 million of net discrete tax expense primarily attributable to the net gains from our investments in Anthropic, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $8.2 billion and $6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, income tax contingencies were approximately $6.5 billion and $5.9 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid.\n\nThe Indian tax authority (“ITA”) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate.

If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include “Cost of sales,” “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” “General and administrative,” and “Other operating expense (income), net.” Our CODM manages our business primarily by reviewing consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis, and using those results along with forecasts and other non-financial information in our annual budgeting process.\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.\n\nInformation on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income is as follows (in millions):\n\nNet sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions):\n\n(1)Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross. We leverage our retail infrastructure to offer a wide selection of consumable and durable goods that includes media products available in both a physical and digital format, such as books, videos, games, music, and software. These product sales include digital products sold on a transactional basis. Digital media content subscriptions that provide unlimited viewing or usage rights are included in “Subscription services.” (2)Includes product sales where our customers physically select items in a store. Sales to customers who order goods online for delivery or pickup at our physical stores are included in “Online stores.” (3)Includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, and other third-party seller services. (4)Includes sales of advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. (5)Includes annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships, as well as digital video, audiobook, digital music, e-book, and other non-AWS subscription services.\n\n(6)Includes sales related to various other offerings (such as shipping services, healthcare services, and certain licensing and distribution of video content) and our co-branded credit card agreements.\n\nTotal segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, other long-term investments, corporate facilities, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, and tax assets. Technology infrastructure assets, which are included in property and equipment, net, net additions, and the depreciation and amortization expense on these assets, are allocated among the segments based on usage, with the majority allocated to the AWS segment. Usage of technology infrastructure assets by the North America and International segments, and the related allocation of total net additions, can fluctuate on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and is affected by seasonality, peak periods, new product or service offerings, and other factors.\n\nTotal segment assets reconciled to consolidated amounts are as follows (in millions):\n\n(1)North America and International segment assets primarily consist of property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, accounts receivable, and digital video and music content.(2)AWS segment assets primarily consist of property and equipment, accounts receivable, and operating leases.\n\nProperty and equipment, net by segment is as follows (in millions):\n\nTotal net additions to property and equipment include technology infrastructure assets and the effect of non-cash activity such as property and equipment acquired but not yet paid.\n\nTotal net additions to property and equipment are as follows (in millions):\n\n(1)Includes property and equipment added under finance leases of $182 million and $432 million in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $324 million and $507 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.(2)Includes property and equipment added under finance leases of $4 million and $545 million in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $85 million and $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, including corporate property and equipment, are allocated to all segments based on usage.", "token_len": 1195, "split_index": 9, "split_count": 11, "parent_chunk_index": 4}

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2025, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $435 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.

Amounts held in foreign currencies were $25.5 billion and $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $26.0 billion and $35.5 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $70.2 billion and $85.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We expect to use cash on hand to satisfy the settlement of the FTC lawsuit. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(16.9) billion and $(26.1) billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(56.9) billion and $(95.3) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $21.3 billion and $34.2 billion during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $51.6 billion and $89.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network, both of which we expect to increase in 2025 and 2026. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $622 million and $786 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $4.5 billion and $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in convertible notes from Anthropic, including $1.3 billion we invested in Q2 2025. Furthermore, we will invest an additional $1.4 billion in another convertible note in Q4 2025.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2.8) billion and $(44) million for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(8.5) billion and $(2.6) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $2.6 billion and $7.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $4.5 billion and $3.3 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $11.1 billion and $10.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $186 million and $977 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $409 million and $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of September 30, 2025. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and the resulting U.S. tax liability is reduced by tax credits, primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. The 2025 Tax Act makes changes to the U.S. corporate income tax, including reinstating the option to claim 100% accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property, with retroactive application beginning January 20, 2025 and immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, with retroactive application beginning January 1, 2025. The 2025 Tax Act will significantly decrease our cash taxes in 2025. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $8.2 billion and $6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.As of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $3.5 billion. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies” and “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.", "token_len": 1765, "split_index": 1, "split_count": 2, "parent_chunk_index": 7}

These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 8 — Segment Information.”\n\nMacroeconomic factors, including changes in inflation and interest rates, global economic and geopolitical developments, including unpredictable shifts in global tariff and trade policies, and the development and adoption of technologies and services, including artificial intelligence, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to predict, isolate, and quantify. These could affect customer demand for our products and services, our ability to forecast growth needs, expenses, and benefits from new technologies. We expect some or all of them to continue to impact our operations into Q4 2025.\n\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\n\nSales increased 13% in Q3 2025, and 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased net sales by $1.5 billion for Q3 2025, and by $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 11% in Q3 2025, and 10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact North America net sales for Q3 2025, but reduced North America net sales by $611 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.International sales increased 14% in Q3 2025, and 12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the comparable prior year periods.

The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.\n\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in Q3 2025 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by operational efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased cost of sales by $929 million for Q3 2025, and by $917 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.Shipping costs were $23.5 billion and $25.3 billion in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $67.3 billion and $71.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies.

While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.The increase in fulfillment costs in Q3 2025 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by operational efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $214 million for Q3 2025, and by $209 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations.

We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in sales and marketing costs in Q3 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to severance costs and increased advertising expenses. The increase in sales and marketing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased advertising expenses.While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\n\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in Q3 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to severance costs.

In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•local economic and political conditions;•government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection or retaliatory measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, electronic devices, and communications services;•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;•lower levels of use of the internet;•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;•laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade (such as tariff policy changes), foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. In addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade restrictions, tariff policy changes and trade disputes, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.", "token_len": 1041, "split_index": 0, "split_count": 1}

For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales.

In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable.

These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters.

A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition or consumer protection rules, including aspects of Amazon’s operation of its stores, including its fulfillment network and Prime, and certain aspects of AWS’s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online “gatekeepers” through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.

The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors.

We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.", "token_len": 737, "split_index": 0, "split_count": 1}
