    "# Multi-Agent Orchestration Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a minimal v0 orchestration across `planner -> retrieval -> analyst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow:\n",
    "1. Planner performs metadata extraction, intent classification, and query expansion.\n",
    "2. If `retrieval_needed=True`, retrieval agent is invoked with planner outputs.\n",
    "3. Retrieval output is converted to `AnalystPacket` and sent to analyst agent.\n",
    "4. If retrieval is skipped or blocked by missing metadata, analyst still runs with planner context and open issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is intentionally minimal for demonstration; quality-based iterative replanning can be added next.\n"
